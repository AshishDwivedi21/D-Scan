Our diabetes prediction model uses machine learning to analyze health data, such as age, BMI, and glucose levels, to predict an individualâ€™s risk of developing diabetes. 
By leveraging algorithms like Random Forest or Logistic Regression, our model provides accurate risk assessments, enabling early intervention and personalized health strategies. 
This tool can be a game-changer in healthcare by helping organizations implement preventive measures and optimize patient care.
